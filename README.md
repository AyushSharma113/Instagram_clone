# Instagram Clone (MERN Stack)

This is a full-stack Instagram clone application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to register, log in, upload and view images, like posts, and interact with other users in a manner similar to the popular Instagram app.

## Features

* **Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profile using JWT-based authentication.
* **Image Upload**: Users can upload images, and the app will handle image storage with cloud storage (e.g., Cloudinary).
* **Posts**: Users can create posts with captions, view posts from others, and like or comment on them.
* **Likes & Comments**: Users can interact with posts by liking and commenting on them.
* **User Profiles**: Each user has a personal profile, showing their posts, followers, and following information.
* **Following System**: Users can follow/unfollow other users.
* **Responsive UI**: The front-end is designed to be mobile-responsive, mimicking Instagramâ€™s user experience.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**:

  * React.js
  * Redux for state management
  * React Router for navigation
  * Axios for HTTP requests

* **Backend**:

  * Node.js with Express.js
  * MongoDB for database management
  * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
  * Cloudinary for image upload and storage

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/instagram-clone
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
CLOUDINARY_URL=your-cloudinary-url
```

* `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection URI.
* `JWT_SECRET`: Your secret key for signing JWT tokens.
* `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Your Cloudinary URL for image uploads.

#### c. Start the server

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### a. Install dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### b. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory and add the following:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

* `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The URL of your backend server.

#### c. Start the frontend

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
